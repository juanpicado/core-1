# Contributing

This project is managed in a Monorepo structure. We decided to use Lerna for this purpose. If you don't know what a monorepo is, we recommend you to read the core concepts described in [this article](https://medium.com/@maoberlehner/monorepos-in-the-wild-33c6eb246cb9) and [Lerna docs](https://lernajs.io/).

## Investigate

First of all, we encourage you to search issues and find if it is already opened. If not, open a new one with a detailed description. With more details we can help you better.

If you are not sure about the problem, you can talk with us at Discord, in our [general](https://discord.gg/6s5CBRu) or [question channel](https://discord.gg/BVyg4F6).

## Development

To start developing, you should perform some steps to prepare the packages:

1.  Install monorepo dependencies. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as package manager.
    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```
2.  Install packages dependencies and link them together (if have dependency in each). **Note:** If you install or add dependencies in any package manually, ensure that the links with other packages are not broken, in that case repeat this step.
    ```shell
    yarn bootstrap
    ```
3.  Move to package directory to work normally (e.g, pass tests with `yarn test`)

## Committing changes

We follow [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to generate changelogs automatically. Because every commit affects every package in the monorepo, we must specify the package folder in the scope field to generate each changelog correctly. Some examples of use is:
```shell
feat(babel-preset): add basic config
```
```shell
fix(eslint-config): remove unnecessary comment
```
```shell
chore(eslint-config): update some deps
```
