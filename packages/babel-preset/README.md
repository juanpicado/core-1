# @verdaccio/babel-preset

Configurable Babel preset for Verdaccio projects

## Usage

To use the preset in your `.babelrc` file, you have to add it using:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@verdaccio"]
}
```

This preset is configurable with several options. With them, we can customize your Babel experience enabling and disabling some presets and plugins. If you want to use in a React project, you only have to add like:

```json
{
  "presets": [["@verdaccio", { "enableReact": true }]]
}
```
